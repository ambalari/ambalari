## Hey👋

I'm Larysa! Nice to meet you.

I’m a frontend developer passionate about building interfaces that truly connect with users. My stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind. I care about clean code, thoughtful UX, and performance.

Beyond development, I have experience in SMM, content marketing, SEO, and freelance project management. I’m comfortable working with Agile, Scrum, and Kanban, and I use tools like Notion, Asana, Trello, and GitHub Projects with ease.
